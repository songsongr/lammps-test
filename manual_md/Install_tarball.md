You can download a current LAMMPS tarball from the [download page](https://www.lammps.org/download.html){.reference .external} of the [LAMMPS website](https://www.lammps.org){.reference .external} or from GitHub (see below).

You have two choices of tarballs, either the most recent stable release or the most recent feature release. Stable releases occur a few times per year, and undergo more testing before release. Also, between stable releases bug fixes from the feature releases are back-ported and the tarball occasionally updated. Feature releases occur every 4 to 8 weeks. The new contents in all feature releases are listed on the [bug and feature page](https://www.lammps.org/bug.html){.reference .external} of the LAMMPS homepage.

Tarballs of older LAMMPS versions can also be downloaded from [this page](https://download.lammps.org/tars/){.reference .external}.

Tarballs downloaded from the LAMMPS homepage include the pre-translated LAMMPS documentation (HTML and PDF files) corresponding to that version.

Once you have a tarball, uncompress and untar it with the following command:

:::: {.highlight-bash .notranslate}
::: highlight
    tar -xzvf lammps*.tar.gz
:::
::::

This will create a LAMMPS directory with the version date in its name, e.g. [`lammps-28Mar23`{.docutils .literal .notranslate}]{.pre}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also download a compressed tar or zip archives from the "Assets" sections of the [LAMMPS GitHub releases site](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases){.reference .external}. The file name will be lammps-\<version\>.zip which can be unzipped with the following command, to create a lammps-\<version\> directory:

:::: {.highlight-bash .notranslate}
::: highlight
    unzip lammps*.zip
:::
::::

This version corresponds to the selected LAMMPS feature or stable release (as indicated by the matching git tag) and will only contain the source code and no pre-built documentation.
