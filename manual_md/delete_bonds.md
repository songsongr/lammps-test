## Description[](#description "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

Turn off (or on) molecular topology interactions (i.e., bonds, angles, dihedrals, and/or impropers). This command is useful for deleting interactions that have been previously turned off by bond-breaking potentials. It is also useful for turning off topology interactions between frozen or rigid atoms. Pairwise interactions can be turned off via the [[neigh_modify exclude]{.doc}]neigh_modify.md){.reference .internal} command. The [[fix shake]{.doc}]fix_shake.md){.reference .internal} command also effectively turns off certain bond and angle interactions.

For all styles, by default, an interaction is only turned off (or on) if all the atoms involved are in the specified group. See the *any* keyword to change the behavior.

::: {.warning .admonition}
Possible errors caused by using *delete_bonds*

Since this command by default only *turns off* bonded interactions, their definitions are still present and subject to the limitations due to LAMMPS' domain decomposition based parallelization. That is, when a bond is turned off, the two constituent atoms may move apart and may reach a distance where they can lead to a "bond atoms missing" error and crash the simulation. Adding the *remove* keyword (see below) is required to fully remove those interactions and prevent the error.
:::

Several of the styles (*atom*, *bond*, *angle*, *dihedral*, *improper*) take a *type* as an argument. The specified *type* can be a [[type label]{.doc}]Howto_type_labels.md){.reference .internal}. Otherwise, the type should be an integer from 0 to [\\(N\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, where [\\(N\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} is the number of relevant types (atom types, bond types, etc.). A value of 0 is only relevant for style *bond*; see details below. For numeric types, a wildcard asterisk can be used in place of or in conjunction with the *type* argument to specify a range of types. This takes the form "\*" or "\*n" or "m\*" or "m\*n". If [\\(N\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} is the number of types, then an asterisk with no numeric values means all types from 0 to [\\(N\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}. A leading asterisk means all types from 0 to n (inclusive). A trailing asterisk means all types from m to N (inclusive). A middle asterisk means all types from m to n (inclusive). Note that it is fine to include a type of 0 for non-bond styles; it will simply be ignored.

For style *multi* all bond, angle, dihedral, and improper interactions of any type, involving atoms in the group, are turned off.

Style *atom* is the same as style *multi* except that in addition, one or more of the atoms involved in the bond, angle, dihedral, or improper interaction must also be of the specified atom type.

For style *bond*, only bonds are candidates for turn-off, and the bond must also be of the specified type. Styles *angle*, *dihedral*, and *improper* are treated similarly.

For style *bond*, you can set the type to 0 to delete bonds that have been previously broken by a bond-breaking potential (which sets the bond type to 0 when a bond is broken); for example, see the [[bond_style quartic]{.doc}]bond_style.md){.reference .internal} command.

For style *stats* no interactions are turned off (or on); the status of all interactions in the specified group is simply reported. This is useful for diagnostic purposes if bonds have been turned off by a bond-breaking potential during a previous run.

::: {.note .admonition}
Impact on special_bonds processing and exclusions

The default behavior of the delete_bonds command is to turn off interactions by toggling their type to a negative value, but not to permanently remove the interaction. For example, a bond_type of 2 is set to [\\(-2.\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} The neighbor list creation routines will not include such an interaction in their interaction lists. The default is also to not alter the list of 1--2, 1--3, or 1--4 neighbors computed by the [[special_bonds]{.doc}]special_bonds.md){.reference .internal} command and used to weight pairwise force and energy calculations. This means that pairwise computations will proceed as if the bond (or angle, etc.) were still turned on.
:::

Several keywords can be appended to the argument list to alter the default behaviors.

The *any* keyword changes the requirement that all atoms in the bond (angle, etc.) must be in the specified group in order to turn off the interaction. Instead, if any of the atoms in the interaction are in the specified group, it will be turned off (or on if the *undo* keyword is used).

The *undo* keyword inverts the delete_bonds command so that the specified bonds, angles, etc. are turned on if they are currently turned off. This means a negative value is toggled to positive. For example, for style *angle*, if *type* is specified as 2, then all angles with current type = [\\(-2\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} are reset to type = [\\(2\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}. Note that the [[fix shake]{.doc}]fix_shake.md){.reference .internal} command also sets bond and angle types negative, so this option should not be used on those interactions.

The *remove* keyword is invoked at the end of the delete_bonds operation. It causes turned-off bonds (angles, etc.) to be removed from each atom's data structure and then adjusts the global bond (angle, etc.) counts accordingly. Removal is a permanent change; removed bonds cannot be turned back on via the *undo* keyword. Removal does not alter the pairwise 1--2, 1--3, or 1--4 weighting list.

The *special* keyword is invoked at the end of the delete_bonds operation, after (optional) removal. It re-computes the pairwise 1--2, 1--3, 1--4 weighting list. The weighting list computation treats turned-off bonds the same as turned-on. Thus, turned-off bonds must be removed if you wish to change the weighting list.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

The choice of *remove* and *special* options affects how 1--2, 1--3, 1--4 pairwise interactions will be computed across bonds that have been modified by the delete_bonds command.

::: {#restrictions .section}
## Restrictions[](#restrictions "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

This command requires inter-processor communication to acquire ghost atoms, to coordinate the deleting of bonds, angles, etc. between atoms shared by multiple processors. This means that your system must be ready to perform a simulation before using this command (force fields setup, atom masses set, etc.). Just as would be needed to run dynamics, the force field you define should define a cutoff (e.g., through a [[pair_style]{.doc}]pair_style.md){.reference .internal} command) which is long enough for a processor to acquire the ghost atoms its needs to compute bond, angle, etc. interactions.

If deleted bonds (or angles, etc.) are removed but the 1--2, 1--3, and 1--4 weighting list is not recomputed, this can cause a later [[fix shake]{.doc}]fix_shake.md){.reference .internal} command to fail due to an atom's bonds being inconsistent with the weighting list. This should only happen if the group used in the fix command includes both atoms in the bond, in which case you probably should be recomputing the weighting list.
