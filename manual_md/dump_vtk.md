## Description[](#description "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every [\\(N\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} timesteps in a format readable by the [VTK visualization toolkit](https://vtk.org){.reference .external} or other visualization tools that use it, such as [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org){.reference .external}. The time steps on which dump output is written can also be controlled by a variable; see the [[dump_modify every]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command for details.

This dump style is similar to [[dump_style custom]{.doc}]dump.md){.reference .internal} but uses the VTK library to write data to VTK simple legacy or XML format, depending on the filename extension specified for the dump file. This can be either *\*.vtk* for the legacy format or *\*.vtp* and *\*.vtu*, respectively, for XML format; see the [VTK homepage](https://vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf){.reference .external} for a detailed description of these formats. Since this naming convention conflicts with the way binary output is usually specified (see below), the [[dump_modify binary]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command allows setting of a binary option for this dump style explicitly.

Only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped. The [[dump_modify thresh and region]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} commands can also alter what atoms are included; see details below.

As described below, special characters ("\*", "%") in the filename determine the kind of output.

::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation box.
:::

::: {.admonition .warning}
Warning

Unless the [[dump_modify sort]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} option is invoked, the lines of atom information written to dump files will be in an indeterminate order for each snapshot. This is even true when running on a single processor, if the [[atom_modify sort]{.doc}]atom_modify.md){.reference .internal} option is on, which it is by default. In this case atoms are re-ordered periodically during a simulation, due to spatial sorting. It is also true when running in parallel, because data for a single snapshot is collected from multiple processors, each of which owns a subset of the atoms.
:::

For the *vtk* style, sorting is off by default. See the [[dump_modify]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} page for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dimensions of the simulation box are written to a separate file for each snapshot (either in legacy VTK or XML format depending on the format of the main dump file) with the suffix *\_boundingBox* appended to the given dump filename.

For an orthogonal simulation box this information is saved as a rectilinear grid (legacy .vtk or .vtr XML format).

Triclinic simulation boxes (non-orthogonal) are saved as hexahedrons in either legacy .vtk or .vtu XML format.

Style *vtk* allows you to specify a list of atom attributes to be written to the dump file for each atom. The list of possible attributes is the same as for the [[dump_style custom]{.doc}]dump.md){.reference .internal} command; see its documentation page for a listing and an explanation of each attribute.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

Since position data is required to write VTK files the atom attributes "x y z" do not have to be specified explicitly; they will be included in the dump file regardless. Also, in contrast to the *custom* style, the specified *vtk* attributes are rearranged to ensure correct ordering of vector components (except for computes and fixes - these have to be given in the right order) and duplicate entries are removed.
:::

The VTK format uses a single snapshot of the system per file, thus a wildcard "\*" must be included in the filename, as discussed below. Otherwise the dump files will get overwritten with the new snapshot each time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the minimization converges. Note that this means a dump will not be performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked, if the current timestep is not a multiple of N. This behavior can be changed via the [[dump_modify first]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command, which can also be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization ended on an arbitrary timestep. N can be changed between runs by using the [[dump_modify every]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command. The [[dump_modify every]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command also allows a variable to be used to determine the sequence of timesteps on which dump files are written. In this mode a dump on the first timestep of a run will also not be written unless the [[dump_modify first]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command is used.

Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters. If a "\*" character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is written and the "\*" character is replaced with the timestep value. For example, tmp.dump\*.vtk becomes tmp.dump0.vtk, tmp.dump10000.vtk, tmp.dump20000.vtk, etc. Note that the [[dump_modify pad]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command can be used to ensure all timestep numbers are the same length (e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files in order with some post-processing tools.

If a "%" character appears in the filename, then each of P processors writes a portion of the dump file, and the "%" character is replaced with the processor ID from 0 to P-1 preceded by an underscore character. For example, tmp.dump%.vtp becomes tmp.dump_0.vtp, tmp.dump_1.vtp, ... tmp.dump_P-1.vtp, etc. This creates smaller files and can be a fast mode of output on parallel machines that support parallel I/O for output.

By default, P = the number of processors meaning one file per processor, but P can be set to a smaller value via the *nfile* or *fileper* keywords of the [[dump_modify]{.doc}]dump_modify.md){.reference .internal} command. These options can be the most efficient way of writing out dump files when running on large numbers of processors.

For the legacy VTK format "%" is ignored and P = 1, i.e., only processor 0 does write files.

Note that using the "\*" and "%" characters together can produce a large number of small dump files!

If *dump_modify binary* is used, the dump file (or files, if "\*" or "%" is also used) is written in binary format. A binary dump file will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically write out much faster.

::: {#restrictions .section}
## Restrictions[](#restrictions "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

The *vtk* style does not support writing of gzipped dump files.

The *vtk* dump style is part of the VTK package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. See the [[Build package]{.doc}]Build_package.md){.reference .internal} page for more info.

To use this dump style, you also must link to the VTK library. See the info in lib/vtk/README and ensure the Makefile.lammps file in that directory is appropriate for your machine.

The *vtk* dump style supports neither buffering or custom format strings.

## Default[](#default "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

By default, files are written in ASCII format. If the file extension is not one of .vtk, .vtp or .vtu, the legacy VTK file format is used.
