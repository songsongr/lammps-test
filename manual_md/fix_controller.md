## Description[](#description "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

This fix enables control of a LAMMPS simulation using a control loop feedback mechanism known as a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The basic idea is to define a "process variable" which is a quantity that can be monitored during a running simulation. A desired target value is chosen for the process variable. A "control variable" is also defined which is an adjustable attribute of the running simulation, which the process variable will respond to. The PID controller continuously adjusts the control variable based on the difference between the process variable and the target.

Here are examples of ways in which this fix can be used. The examples/pid directory contains a script that implements the simple thermostat.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

For this fix to work, the control variable must actually induce a change in a running LAMMPS simulation. Typically this will only occur if there is some other command (e.g. a thermostat fix) which uses the control variable as an input parameter. This could be done directly or indirectly, e.g. the other command uses a variable as input whose formula uses the control variable. The other command should alter its behavior dynamically as the variable changes.
:::

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

If there is a command you think could be used in this fashion, but does not currently allow a variable as an input parameter, please notify the LAMMPS developers. It is often not difficult to enable a command to use a variable as an input parameter.
:::

The group specified with this command is ignored. However, note that the process variable may be defined by calculations performed by computes and fixes which store their own "group" definitions.

The PID controller is invoked once each *Nevery* timesteps.

The PID controller is implemented as a discretized version of the following dynamic equation:

::: {.math .notranslate .nohighlight}
\\\[\\frac{dc}{dt} = -\\alpha (K_p e + K_i \\int_0\^t e \\, dt + K_d \\frac{de}{dt} )\\\]
:::

where *c* is the continuous time analog of the control variable, *e* =*pvar*-*setpoint* is the error in the process variable, and [\\(\\alpha\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, [\\(K_i\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} , and [\\(K_d\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} are constants set by the corresponding keywords described above. The discretized version of this equation is:

::: {.math .notranslate .nohighlight}
\\\[c_n = c\_{n-1} -\\alpha \\left( K_p \\tau e_n + K_i \\tau\^2 \\sum\_{i=1}\^n e_i + K_d (e_n - e\_{n-1}) \\right)\\\]
:::

where [\\(\\tau = \\mathtt{Nevery} \\cdot \\mathtt{timestep}\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} is the time interval between updates, and the subscripted variables indicate the values of *c* and *e* at successive updates.

From the first equation, it is clear that if the three gain values [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, [\\(K_i\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, [\\(K_d\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} are dimensionless constants, then [\\(\\alpha\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} must have units of \[unit *cvar*\]/\[unit *pvar*\]/\[unit time\] e.g. \[ eV/K/ps \]. The advantage of this unit scheme is that the value of the constants should be invariant under a change of either the MD timestep size or the value of *Nevery*. Similarly, if the LAMMPS [[unit style]{.doc}]units.md){.reference .internal} is changed, it should only be necessary to change the value of [\\(\\alpha\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} to reflect this, while leaving [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, [\\(K_i\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}, and [\\(K_d\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} unaltered.

When choosing the values of the four constants, it is best to first pick a value and sign for [\\(\\alpha\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} that is consistent with the magnitudes and signs of *pvar* and *cvar*. The magnitude of [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} should then be tested over a large positive range keeping [\\(K_i = K_d =0\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}. A good value for [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} will produce a fast response in *pvar*, without overshooting the *setpoint*. For many applications, proportional feedback is sufficient, and so [\\(K_i = K_d =0\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} can be used. In cases where there is a substantial lag time in the response of *pvar* to a change in *cvar*, this can be counteracted by increasing [\\(K_d\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}. In situations where *pvar* plateaus without reaching *setpoint*, this can be counteracted by increasing [\\(K_i\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight}. In the language of Charles Dickens, [\\(K_p\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} represents the error of the present, [\\(K_i\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} the error of the past, and [\\(K_d\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} the error yet to come.

Because this fix updates *cvar*, but does not initialize its value, the initial value [\\(c_0\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} is that assigned by the user in the input script via the [[internal-style variable]{.doc}]variable.md){.reference .internal} command. This value is used (by every other LAMMPS command that uses the variable) until this fix performs its first update of *cvar* after *Nevery* timesteps. On the first update, the value of the derivative term is set to zero, because the value of [\\(e\_{n-1}\\)]{.math .notranslate .nohighlight} is not yet defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The process variable *pvar* can be specified as the output of a [[compute]{.doc}]compute.md){.reference .internal} or [[fix]{.doc}]fix.md){.reference .internal} or the evaluation of a [[variable]{.doc}]variable.md){.reference .internal}. In each case, the compute, fix, or variable must produce a global quantity, not a per-atom or local quantity.

If *pvar* begins with "c\_", a compute ID must follow which has been previously defined in the input script and which generates a global scalar or vector. See the individual [[compute]{.doc}]compute.md){.reference .internal} doc page for details. If no bracketed integer is appended, the scalar calculated by the compute is used. If a bracketed integer is appended, the Ith value of the vector calculated by the compute is used. Users can also write code for their own compute styles and [[add them to LAMMPS]{.doc}]Modify.md){.reference .internal}.

If *pvar* begins with "f\_", a fix ID must follow which has been previously defined in the input script and which generates a global scalar or vector. See the individual [[fix]{.doc}]fix.md){.reference .internal} page for details. Note that some fixes only produce their values on certain timesteps, which must be compatible with when fix controller references the values, or else an error results. If no bracketed integer is appended, the scalar calculated by the fix is used. If a bracketed integer is appended, the Ith value of the vector calculated by the fix is used. Users can also write code for their own fix style and [[add them to LAMMPS]{.doc}]Modify.md){.reference .internal}.

If *pvar* begins with "v\_", a variable name must follow which has been previously defined in the input script. Only equal-style variables can be referenced. See the [[variable]{.doc}]variable.md){.reference .internal} command for details. Note that variables of style *equal* define a formula which can reference individual atom properties or thermodynamic keywords, or they can invoke other computes, fixes, or variables when they are evaluated, so this is a very general means of specifying the process variable.

The target value *setpoint* for the process variable must be a numeric value, in whatever units *pvar* is defined for.

The control variable *cvar* must be the name of an [[internal-style variable]{.doc}]variable.md){.reference .internal} previously defined in the input script. Note that it is not specified with a "v\_" prefix, just the name of the variable. It must be an internal-style variable, because this fix updates its value directly. Note that other commands can use an equal-style versus internal-style variable interchangeably.

Currently, no information about this fix is written to [[binary restart files]{.doc}]restart.md){.reference .internal}. None of the [[fix_modify]{.doc}]fix_modify.md){.reference .internal} options are relevant to this fix.

This fix produces a global vector with 3 values which can be accessed by various [[output commands]{.doc}]Howto_output.md){.reference .internal}. The values can be accessed on any timestep, though they are only updated on timesteps that are a multiple of *Nevery*.

The three values are the most recent updates made to the control variable by each of the 3 terms in the PID equation above. The first value is the proportional term, the second is the integral term, the third is the derivative term.

The units of the vector values will be whatever units the control variable is in. The vector values calculated by this fix are "extensive".

No parameter of this fix can be used with the *start/stop* keywords of the [[run]{.doc}]run.md){.reference .internal} command. This fix is not invoked during [[energy minimization]{.doc}]minimize.md){.reference .internal}.
