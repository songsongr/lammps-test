## Description[](#description "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

These commands perform time integration on Nose-Hoover style non-Hamiltonian equations of motion for nuclei and electrons in the group for the [[electron force field]{.doc}]pair_eff.md){.reference .internal} model. The fixes are designed to generate positions and velocities sampled from the canonical (nvt), isothermal-isobaric (npt), and isenthalpic (nph) ensembles. This is achieved by adding some dynamic variables which are coupled to the particle velocities (thermostatting) and simulation domain dimensions (barostatting). In addition to basic thermostatting and barostatting, these fixes can also create a chain of thermostats coupled to the particle thermostat, and another chain of thermostats coupled to the barostat variables. The barostat can be coupled to the overall box volume, or to individual dimensions, including the *xy*, *xz* and *yz* tilt dimensions. The external pressure of the barostat can be specified as either a scalar pressure (isobaric ensemble) or as components of a symmetric stress tensor (constant stress ensemble). When used correctly, the time-averaged temperature and stress tensor of the particles will match the target values specified by Tstart/Tstop and Pstart/Pstop.

The operation of these fixes is exactly like that described by the [[fix nvt, npt, and nph]{.doc}]fix_nh.md){.reference .internal} commands, except that the radius and radial velocity of electrons are also updated. Likewise the temperature and pressure calculated by the fix, using the computes it creates (as discussed in the [[fix nvt, npt, and nph]{.doc}]fix_nh.md){.reference .internal} doc page), are performed with computes that include the eFF contribution to the temperature or kinetic energy from the electron radial velocity.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

there are two different pressures that can be reported for eFF when defining the pair_style (see [[pair eff/cut]{.doc}]pair_eff.md){.reference .internal} to understand these settings), one (default) that considers electrons do not contribute radial virial components (i.e. electrons treated as incompressible 'rigid' spheres) and one that does. The radial electronic contributions to the virials are only tallied if the flexible pressure option is set, and this will affect both global and per-atom quantities. In principle, the true pressure of a system is somewhere in between the rigid and the flexible eFF pressures, but, for most cases, the difference between these two pressures will not be significant over long-term averaged runs (i.e. even though the energy partitioning changes, the total energy remains similar).
:::

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

currently, there is no available option for the user to set or create temperature distributions that include the radial electronic degrees of freedom with the [[velocity]{.doc}]velocity.md){.reference .internal} command, so the the user must allow for these degrees of freedom to equilibrate (i.e. equi-partitioning of energy) through time integration.

## Restrictions[](#restrictions "Link to this heading"){.headerlink}

This fix is part of the EFF package. It is only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. See the [[Build package]{.doc}]Build_package.md){.reference .internal} page for more info.

Other restriction discussed on the page for the [[fix nvt, npt, and nph]{.doc}]fix_nh.md){.reference .internal} commands also apply.

::: {.admonition .note}
Note

The temperature for systems (regions or groups) with only electrons and no nuclei is 0.0 (i.e. not defined) in the current temperature calculations, a practical example would be a uniform electron gas or a very hot plasma, where electrons remain delocalized from the nuclei. This is because, even though electron virials are included in the temperature calculation, these are averaged over the nuclear degrees of freedom only. In such cases a corrective term must be added to the pressure to get the correct kinetic contribution.
